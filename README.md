# DU-Landing-Lights
Landing lights for Dual Universe

This script will cause a light to blink, or a set of lights to blink in sequence, whenever your ship is landing.

Requires a hover engine to be attached to the control chair, with relevant slot renamed 'hover'.

Attach 1-5 lights to your control chair and rename thier slots lights1, lights2, lights3, lights4, lights5. You may also attach a manual switch or switches with the same names, link the switch to a relay, and link the relay to multiples lights to have more lights blinking.

Add or append all filters with the included script.

Use the LightSpeed parameter to adjust blinking speed.
